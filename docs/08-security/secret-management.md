# Secret Management

## Policy

Secrets are stored in approved runtime secret stores or CI secret facilities. Access is scoped per service. Rotation, revocation, logging, and break-glass procedures are documented.

## Required Controls

- Least privilege
- Authentication and authorization
- Audit logging
- Secret redaction
- Fail-closed behavior for release controls
- Documented recovery and revocation

## Verification

Controls are verified by the security test plan and reviewed before each public release.
