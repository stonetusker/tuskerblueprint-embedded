# Artifact Signing

## Policy

Mender artifacts are signed with a protected release key. CI build jobs do not receive unrestricted long-lived signing authority. Verification occurs before upload and on the device path where supported.

## Required Controls

- Least privilege
- Authentication and authorization
- Audit logging
- Secret redaction
- Fail-closed behavior for release controls
- Documented recovery and revocation

## Verification

Controls are verified by the security test plan and reviewed before each public release.
