# Acceptance Test Plan

## Objective

The public release acceptance run builds from a clean environment, uses shared cache, passes QEMU, creates a signed candidate, updates a canary, demonstrates rollback, and completes an AI-assisted approved rebuild.

## Evidence Requirements

- Test identifier and version
- Requirement identifiers
- Environment and input revisions
- Start and end time
- Result and failure reason
- Artifact checksums
- Evidence location
- Reviewer

## Pass Rule

A pass requires all mandatory expectations. A partial result is recorded as failed or blocked, never silently accepted.
