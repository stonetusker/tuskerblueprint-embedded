# Evidence Policy

## Objective

Large logs and binaries remain outside Git. Git stores Markdown summaries, checksums, build identifiers, immutable URIs, approval references, and a reviewer conclusion.

## Evidence Requirements

- Test identifier and version
- Requirement identifiers
- Environment and input revisions
- Start and end time
- Result and failure reason
- Artifact checksums
- Evidence location
- Reviewer

## Pass Rule

A pass requires all mandatory expectations. A partial result is recorded as failed or blocked, never silently accepted.
