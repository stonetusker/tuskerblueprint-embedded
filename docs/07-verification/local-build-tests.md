# Local Build Tests

## Objective

Verify pinned source retrieval, unprivileged builder execution, image generation, metadata creation, expected output files, and repeatability from a clean workspace.

## Evidence Requirements

- Test identifier and version
- Requirement identifiers
- Environment and input revisions
- Start and end time
- Result and failure reason
- Artifact checksums
- Evidence location
- Reviewer

## Pass Rule

A pass requires all mandatory expectations. A partial result is recorded as failed or blocked, never silently accepted.
