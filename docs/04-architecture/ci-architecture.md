# CI Architecture

## Purpose

Pull requests validate specifications, application code, metadata, and selected builds without deployment credentials. Main builds produce candidates and QEMU evidence. Promotion is separate and consumes an existing immutable candidate.


## Key Decisions

- Build and release implementation lives in repository scripts, not CI-specific logic.
- GitHub Actions is authoritative for continuous build.
- Jenkins exists for the enterprise diagnostic story and cannot promote OTA releases.
- QEMU is a virtual validation gate, not physical-board certification.
- Promotion uses the exact tested artifact.
- AI remains advisory and least-privileged.

## Failure Handling

Failures must be classified, retained as evidence, and prevented from silently producing a release. Timeouts, cleanup, retries, and escalation are component responsibilities.

## Evolution

Any move to shared Project A infrastructure must preserve artifact identity, approval boundaries, least privilege, and evidence continuity.
